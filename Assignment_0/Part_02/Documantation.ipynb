    "### Calling ASM routine from C program\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the routines `add` and `display_result` present in the assembly code `add.s` available for the C program, they have been marked `global` in the `.text` section as follows:\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "section .text\n",
    "  global add\n",
    "  global display_result\n",
    "  global display_statement\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, the function headers for these have been marked as `extern` to aid the compiler with the linking process:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "extern int add(int a, int b);\n",
    "extern void display_result(char * result, int len);\n",
    "extern void display_statement();\n",
    "\n",

    "### x86-64 Register Calling \n",
    "\n",
    "When any ASM routine is called from the C program, the actual arguments of the routine call are stored in the general registers and the stack. If there are 6 or less arguments, they are passed to the registers. In case of more than 6 arguments, the first six are passed to the registers, and the remaining are pushed to the program's stack. The first six arguments are stored in the registers as follows:\n",
    "- `rdi`: first argument\n",
    "- `rsi`: second argument\n",
    "- `rdx`: third argument\n",
    "- `rcx`: fourth argument\n",
    "- `r8`: fifth argument\n",
    "- `r9`: sixth argument\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add` routine takes the two integer values input by the user as arguments, and stores them in the `rdi` and `rsi` registers. After adding `rsi` to `rdi`, the value stored in `rdi` is moved to `rax` for returning to the C program as follows:\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "add:\n",
    "  add rdi, rsi\n",
    "  mov rax, rdi\n",
    "  ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, the `display_result` routine takes the display string and its length as arguments, and stores them in registers `rdi` and `rsi`. For making the syscall for write, the string length in `rsi` is moved to `rdx`, the result string in `rdi` is moved to `rsi`, `rax` is changed to `1` to indicate `sys_write`, and `rdi` is changed to `1` to indicate `STDOUT` as follows:\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "  mov rdx, rsi\n",
    "  mov rsi, rdi\n",
    "  mov rax, 1\n",
    "  mov rdi, 1\n",
    "  syscall\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the exist syscall after displaying the result, `rax` is changed to `60` to indicate `sys_exit`, `rdi` is changed to `0` to indicate successful execution as follows:\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "  mov rax, 60\n",
    "  mov rdi, 0\n",
    "  syscall\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Makefile and compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the assembly program `add.s` is assembled to generate the object file `add.o` using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "nasm -f elf64 add.s -o add.o\n",
    "```\n",
    "`-f elf64` informs the compiler that it is a 64-bit assembly code, and that the output has to be of elf 64 bit format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the C program `prog-add.c` and the assembly object file `add.o` are compiled and linked to form a single executable using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "gcc prog-add.c add.o -o prog-add\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both these commands can be executed by using the `make` command. The object file `add.o` and executable `prog-add` can be removed using the `make clean` command.\n",
